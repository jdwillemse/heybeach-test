This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the project

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Notes

- I assumed that with 'Image title' (instruction 4)
- I found the wireframe and the instruction to implement a masonry layout (instruction 6) to contradict each other. I therefore disregarded the wireframe when it came to the list layout.
- I know you don't like 3rd party libs but I ran out of time before being able to implement the masonry layout.

I did not complete the task so if there is anything specifically that you still want me to demonstrate please let me know.

## Feedback

The user API is terrible. I do not know if this is deliberate or not, but the API responds with three different styles of error depending which endpoint fails and how it fails. This is time-consuming to debug so if it is not deliberate I'd suggest you save future candidates some time and standardise and document the API. Validation rules would be helpful.
